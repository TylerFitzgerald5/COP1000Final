This is my final project for class. It is designed to parse Pokemon Showdown replay links and pull data of interest. It will also (hopefully) contain a storage database and/or automatic replay link scraper further down the line so that it can be used to gather data.

Pokemon.py is the main file. Running will ask for a replay link.
